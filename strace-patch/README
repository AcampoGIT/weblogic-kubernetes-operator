This branch:

  1) Modifies WLS pods to use image store/oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3-strace

  2) Requires manually running build.sh in this directory to build this image, and additional manual commands to push this image to public repos as needed...

  3) Modifies the WLS pod's 'startServer.sh' script to 'strace' WLS processes to file '/tmp/trace.<instance>.<pid>.out'.  (instance increments each time NM restarts WLS)
