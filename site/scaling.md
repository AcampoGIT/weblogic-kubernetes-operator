# Sacling a WebLogic cluster

Explain how the scaling works – replicas, etc., the REST endpoint.

## Initiating a scaling operation using the REST API

Scaling up (or down) of a WebLogic *cluster* provides increased reliability of customer applications as well as optimization of resource usage.  Scaling of WebLogic *clusters*, in Kubernetes cloud environments, involves scaling the corresponding *pods* in which WebLogic managed server instances are running.  Since the *operator* manages the lifecycle of a WebLogic Server *domain*, the *operator* exposes a REST API that allows an authorized actor to request scaling of a WebLogic *cluster*.

NOTE: In the Technology Preview release, only WebLogic configured *clusters* are supported by the *operator*, and the *operator* will only scale up to the number of managed servers that are already defined.  Support for WebLogic dynamic *clusters*, and for scaling configured *clusters* to more servers than are defined is planned for a future release.

The following URL format is used for describing the resources for scaling (scale up and scale down) of a WebLogic *cluster*:

```
http(s)://${OPERATOR_ENDPOINT}/operator/<version>/domains/<domainUID>/clusters/<clusterName>/scale
```

For example:

```
http(s)://${OPERATOR_ENDPOINT}/operator/v1/domains/domain1/clusters/cluster-1/scale
```

In this URL format:

*	`OPERATOR_ENDPOINT` is the host/port of the *operator* service.
*	`<version>` denotes the version of the REST resource.
*	`<domainUID>` is the unique identifier of the WebLogic *domain*.
*	`<clusterName>` is the name of the WebLogic *cluster* to be scaled.

The `/scale` REST endpoint accepts an HTTP POST request and the request body supports the JSON `"application/json"` media type.  The request body will be a simple name/value item named `managedServerCount` for example:

```
{
    "managedServerCount": 3
}
```

The `managedServerCount` value designates the number of WebLogic Server instances to scale to.  Note that the scale resource is implemented using the JAX-RS framework, and so a successful scaling request will return an HTTP response code of `204 (“No Content”)` since the resource method’s return type is void and does not return a message body.

## What does the operator do in response to a scaling request?

When the *operator* receives a scaling request, it will:

*	Perform an authentication and authorization check that the specified user is allowed to perform the specified operation on the specified resource.
*	Validate that the specified *domain*, identified by `domainUID`, exists.
*	Validate that the WebLogic *cluster*, identified by `clusterName`, exists.
*	Verify that the specified WebLogic *cluster* has enough configured servers to satisfy the scaling request.
*	Initiate scaling by setting the `replicas` property within the corresponding *domain custom resource* either in:
  *	a `clusterStartup` entry if defined within its *cluster* list.
  *	at the *domain* level, if not defined in a `clusterStartup` entry and the `startupControl` property is set to `AUTO`.

In response to a change to either `replicas` property, in the *domain custom resource*, the *operator* will increase/decrease the number of *pods* (managed servers) to match the desired replica count.
